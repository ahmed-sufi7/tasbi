# Firebase Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Activate FlutterFire CLI

Run this command to install the FlutterFire CLI globally:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

## Step 2: Configure Firebase

Run this command to configure Firebase for your project:

```bash
flutterfire configure --project=digital-tasbi-1
```

This will:
1. Connect to your Firebase project `digital-tasbi-1`
2. Generate platform-specific configuration files:
   - `android/app/google-services.json` (Android)
   - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
   - `lib/firebase_options.dart` (Dart configuration)
3. Select the platforms you want to support (Android, iOS, etc.)

## Step 3: Verify Configuration

After running the command, verify that the following files were created:

- âœ… `android/app/google-services.json`
- âœ… `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (if iOS selected)
- âœ… `lib/firebase_options.dart`

## Step 4: Update main.dart (Already Done)

The main.dart file is already configured to initialize Firebase:

```dart
// Initialize Firebase
try {
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
} catch (e) {
  debugPrint('Firebase initialization error: $e');
}
```

## Step 5: Enable Firebase Services

In your Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/):

1. **Enable Cloud Messaging**:
   - Go to Project Settings > Cloud Messaging
   - Note: FCM is enabled by default

2. **Enable Analytics (Optional)**:
   - Go to Project Settings > Integrations
   - Enable Google Analytics if desired

## Step 6: Test Firebase Connection

After configuration, run the app:

```bash
flutter run
```

Check the console output for:
- âœ… "Firebase initialized successfully" (no error)
- âœ… FCM token printed in logs

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase project not found"
- Ensure you have access to the project `digital-tasbi-1`
- Check you're logged in: `firebase login`

### Issue: "FlutterFire command not found"
- Add Dart global bin to PATH
- On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin`
- On macOS/Linux: `$HOME/.pub-cache/bin`

### Issue: "Configuration failed"
- Ensure Firebase project exists
- Check internet connection
- Verify Firebase CLI is authenticated

## Next Steps

After successful Firebase configuration:

1. âœ… Firebase is ready to use
2. âœ… Cloud Messaging configured
3. âœ… Run the app and verify services work
4. ðŸ”„ Configure AdMob (see SETUP_GUIDE.md)
5. ðŸ”„ Set up In-App Purchases (see SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**Note**: The firebase_options.dart file will be auto-generated by FlutterFire CLI and should not be manually edited.
